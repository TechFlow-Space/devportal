_Release date: 2020-09-03_ _Docker TAG: 2009031457xdaf395, 2020-09-03 10:00:00 UTC_

The following updates describe the latest improvements in each software package, which uses the following version sequence: loopchain 2.6.0, icon-service 1.7.7, icon-rpc-server 1.5.1, and rewardcalculator 1.2.2. See upgrades and fixes for information about updating to the latest release of ICON Loopchain

To upgrade your docker, set your docker tag to `iconloop/prep-node` in your `docker-compose.yml`. For this upgrade, it is necessary to bring the node down and up, due to changes. Each node needs to be careful not to cause problems in the consensus process:

```text
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
