To upgrade your docker, set your docker tag to `iconloop/prep-node` in your `docker-compose.yml`. For this upgrade, it is necessary to bring the node down and up, due to changes. Each node needs to be careful not to cause problems in the consensus process:

```text
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
