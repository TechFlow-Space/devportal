# 2020-08-27

_Release date: 2020-08-27_ _Docker TAG: 2008271251x7da45b, 2020-08-27 07:00:00 UTC_

The following updates describe the latest improvements in each software package, which uses the following version sequence: loopchain 2.6.0, icon-service 1.7.6, icon-rpc-server 1.5.0, and rewardcalculator 1.2.2. See upgrades and fixes for information about updating to the latest release of ICON Loopchain

To upgrade your docker, set your docker tag to `iconloop/prep-node` in your `docker-compose.yml`. For this upgrade, it is necessary to bring the node down and up, due to changes. Each node needs to be careful not to cause problems in the consensus process:

```text
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### [**ICON Service 1.7.6**](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-service/releases/tag/1.7.6)

* Fix the getBalance API bug to show the address balance properly \(Expired unstaked ICX is not added up to user balance in a specific case\)
