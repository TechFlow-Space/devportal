The following updates describe the latest improvements in each software package, which uses the following version sequence: loopchain 2.7.8, icon-service 1.8.9, icon-rpc-server 1.6.0, and rewardcalculator 1.2.6.

To upgrade your docker, set your docker tag to `iconloop/prep-node` in your `docker-compose.yml`. For this upgrade, it is necessary to bring the node down and up, due to changes. Each node needs to be careful not to cause problems in the consensus process:

```text
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
