_Release date: 2021-03-20 UTC_ _Docker TAG: iconloop/prep-node: 20210314.0, 2021-03-20 18:00:00 UTC_

The following updates describe the latest improvements in each software package, which uses the following version sequence: loopchain 2.7.8, icon-service 1.8.10, icon-rpc-server 1.6.2, and rewardcalculator 1.2.6. See upgrades and fixes for information about updating to the latest release of ICON blockchain-related implementations in the package.

To upgrade your docker, set your docker tag to `iconloop/prep-node` in your `docker-compose.yml`. For this upgrade, it is necessary to bring the node down and up, due to changes. Each node needs to be careful not to cause problems in the consensus process:

```text
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### [**ICON Service 1.8.10**](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-service/releases/tag/1.8.10)

* Added a function to implement rate limit based on 'from address'
