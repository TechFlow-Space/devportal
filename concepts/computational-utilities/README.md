# Computational utilities

### What is a computational utility?

For the context of the ICON technical documentation, a _computational utility_ is an umbrella term that refers to key computational processes or data structures that are logically separated. These utilities, or components, are useful to help people understand how ICON works and how blockchain works in general.
