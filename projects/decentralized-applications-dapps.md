# Decentralized applications (dApps)

### What is a decentralized application?

A _decentralized application (dApp)_ is defined as follows from the ICON glossary:

> Application on a distributed network run by multiple independent operators. Typically refers to applications that operate on or make use of a blockchain

Anyone can develop a decentralized application, either by [developing a smart contract](../icon-stack/smart-contracts/) or by [connecting to an existing contract](../icon-stack/client-apis/). DApps can be secure and verifiable by a blockchain. However, because most dApps contain components that are off of the blockchain, developers and users must consider many of the normal issues of data security, such as [securing connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport\_Layer\_Security) and safely maintaining [Personally Identifiable Information](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-training/what-personally-identifiable-information).
